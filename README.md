# Viserion

Introducing Viserion: integrated fire fighting monitoring and assistance system.

Monitoring is carried out by drones in areas pointed by NASA satellites with possible fire hotspots. Citizens will also be able to use an application to record fire occurrences.

Fire fighting aid will be made with extinguishing balls - by drone - to control or even extinguish the fire until the arrival of firefighters.

You can also check alerts based on incident history and prediction of fire behavior based on weather, wind, and terrain.

This solution enables fire prevention, efficiency and effectiveness.

Our biggest impact is the protection of life.

The system is developed in ReactJS, React Native and Node.js.
